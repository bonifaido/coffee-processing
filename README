coffee-processing
=================

This is my inital attempt to do Processing with CoffeeScript, highly influenced
by ruby-processing.

coffee-processing is just a thin layer between Processing and CoffeeScript glued
together with Rhino.

To use it clone the repo and follow these steps:

This will download Rhino and Processing (may take a while):
bin/bootstrap

This will run a simple example written in CoffeeScript:
bin/csp5 examples/app.coffee

TODO:
- REPL
- onejar
- more examples
- classless sketches
- try other JDK JS engines (Nashorn, dynjs, ...)
- ... a lot of things
